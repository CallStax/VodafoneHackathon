	<p>Your request will go to one of our NGOs who will reach out to you to assess your case and determine how best to help you.</p>
	<p>We appreciate that asking for help is not easy, which is why your <b>privacy is of utmost importance to us</b> and we go to great lengths to safeguard it.</p>
	<p><b>At no point will you be asked to divulge any personal or sensitive information through the Application</b> (all we need is your public key). If in doubt, reach out to your nearest NGO center where you can <b>speak to a representative who can guide you through the process</b>. We recommend you utilise a separate and unused account to get started.</p>
